# timerdec

A timing decorator module.

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/timerdec.git
```

## Usage

This package provides a single decorator, `timerdec`.
The execution of any function decorated with `timerdec` gets timed and the elapsed time is then passed to the provided consumer, that was provided to the decorator in milliseconds.
```python
>>> from timerdec import timerdec
>>> @timerdec(lambda t: print('Took', 1000*t, 'ms.'))
... def foo():
...     for _ in range(1000000):
...         pass
>>> foo()
Took 23.371541989035904 ms.
```
